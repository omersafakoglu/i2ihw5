# Data Management and Processing with Apache Ignite

This project focuses on using Apache Ignite for data management and processing tasks. Apache Ignite is a high-performance, scalable in-memory data grid that provides real-time data processing and fast query capabilities.

Project Steps:

## Apache Ignite Installation:
The latest version of Apache Ignite will be downloaded and installed. After installation, the Ignite server will be started, and any issues encountered during the setup will be resolved.
## Table Creation:
A table will be created in Apache Ignite using SQL commands to manage subscriber information and other relevant data.
## Data Insertion:
Example records will be inserted into the table, and the accuracy of data insertion will be verified.
## Data Querying:
Using Apache Ignite's SQL query features, records from the table will be queried and displayed. This will be achieved through a Java application.

## Objectives:
The objective of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Apache Ignite by exploring its core features and configuration. The project involves implementing data management operations such as table creation, data insertion, and querying within Ignite. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the performance of Ignite in terms of data processing and querying, assessing its efficiency for real-time data management tasks.
