# Data Management and Processing with Apache Ignite

This project focuses on using Apache Ignite for data management and processing tasks. Apache Ignite is a high-performance, scalable in-memory data grid that provides real-time data processing and fast query capabilities.

Project Steps:

## Apache Ignite Installation:
The latest version of Apache Ignite will be downloaded and installed. After installation, the Ignite server will be started, and any issues encountered during the setup will be resolved.
## Table Creation:
A table will be created in Apache Ignite using SQL commands to manage subscriber information and other relevant data.
## Data Insertion:
Example records will be inserted into the table, and the accuracy of data insertion will be verified.
## Data Querying:
Using Apache Ignite's SQL query features, records from the table will be queried and displayed. This will be achieved through a Java application.

## Objectives:
Familiarization with Apache Ignite: Understand the core features and configuration of Apache Ignite.
Data Management: Implement table creation, data insertion, and querying operations using Ignite.
Performance Testing: Assess Igniteâ€™s data processing and query performance, and evaluate its efficiency in managing real-time data.
This project is designed to explore the practical applications of Apache Ignite and demonstrate its capabilities in high-performance data processing and management.
